#STYLE PEP8 
https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/
#CLASS name
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
#MODULE name https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names
keep module names short, lowercase, and be sure to avoid using special symbols like the dot (.) or
question mark (?). A file name like my.spam.py is the one you should avoid! Naming this way will 
interfere with the way Python looks for modules.
