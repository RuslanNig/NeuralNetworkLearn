#NEXT STEP

we should connect entries of each layers with elements of numpy array

we should created function for layer_neurons_button
when we push this button we should get its number, so we should set this number as name
we know how to set the name of widget (and we do it autimatically)
and we know how get the name of the widget


#create in global file settings.py: array for neurons, input of weights, functions
#connect Entry and checkboxes with numpy array of neurons

#STYLE PEP8 
https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/
#CLASS name
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
#MODULE name https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names
keep module names short, lowercase, and be sure to avoid using special symbols like the dot (.) or
question mark (?). A file name like my.spam.py is the one you should avoid! Naming this way will 
interfere with the way Python looks for modules.
